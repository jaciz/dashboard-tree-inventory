# Tree Inventory Dashboard

Using LiDAR, I classified different features in an area, such as vegetation, ground, and buildings. By creating digital surface models and digital terrain models, I was able to generate a tree canopy height model. This model helped me identify individual trees and their heights, which is important for a variety of applications. For example, understanding the distribution and height of trees in an area can be useful for analyzing the impact of urbanization, predicting the amount of shade in a given location, or estimating carbon sequestration. To share my results, I created a Python Streamlit dashboard that displays an inventory of trees, including information on their height, spread, and elevation. The dashboard is hosted on AWS EC2, so that audiences can view insights on the types of trees present in the area.
