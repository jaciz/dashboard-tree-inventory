# Tree Inventory Dashboard

Using LiDAR, I classified different features into specific classes, such as vegetation, ground, and buildings. Based on these classified features, I created digital surface models and digital terrain models to produce a tree canopy height models. The tree canopy model was used to identify tree tops and delineate individual trees. To share the results, I designed and scripted a Python Streamlit dashboard to display an inventory of trees, including information on height, spread, and elevation. The dashboard is hosted on AWS EC2 for audiences to view insights on what types of trees are in the surrounding area.

The dashboard is live! To view, please visit http://geo1treeviewer.com/
